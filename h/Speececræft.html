        <p>
            This is based on a mixture of the <a title="Old English">OE</a> article system and native palatal developments in Middle English. I originally thought <i>þet</i> should replace <i>þat</i> (or <i>þæt</i>), but the reason the pronunciation shifted could be due to the ongoing French influence on grammar at the time.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3 id="One">Indefinite Article declension</h3>
        <p>
            A and An are used today exclusively as the indefinite article, coming from Old English an. What was forgotten in Varad's Reactionary Grammar section (Sticky II of the <a href="/h/WillsomeEnglishEwbook.pdf">Ewbook 2.0</a>) is that "an" is in fact New English "one". Perhaps due to Norman influence, the formation of an → one in early ME became mixed with French on and as a result the older and newer form of the word split. This is further supported by how an was used in Old English as well as fellow West Germanic languages today (Dutch een and German ein) where "one" is the indefinite article and also "a particular" (i.e OE an of ðam → one of those). In a way, this means that our current understanding that "one" meaning "a particular" being from French influence is misconstrued. What's more likely is the underdevelopment of a/an is a result of French influence instead.

        <p>This chart is based on the one above -- a mixture of the pre-Norman declension and how the pronunciation shifts by New English (based on comparisons).</p>
        <br>
        <h4 id="Kiþelies">Demonstratives</h4>
        <p>The last declension I will mention is the demonstratives. This is because the others (such as pronouns, adjectives and numbers) were already being lost in late Old English. For me, these few rules <i>feel</i> like English when put into action. It feels like assembling lost pieces to complete an unfinished puzzle.

          <p>As for <i>That</i>, one could assume it follows similar declension to the definitive article since it was the original neuter singular it. This is an assumption, so take it with a grain of salt, but it should work for Willsome English.</p>
