        <a class="lingo" title="mobs">warries</a> and <a class="lingo" title="Fearing, easily frightened">friþful</a> <a class="lingo" title="Animals (as opposed to specifically deer)">deer</a>. Þis can be done by delfing undergrunde to get þings like coal, iron, redstone, and <a class="lingo" title="diamond(?)">hardstone</a>. Warries will <a class="lingo" title="spawn, as a verb">atew</a> in þe darknes, so its needful to make <a class="lingo" title="torches">þecens</a> to <a class="lingo" title="light up">aliten</a> þe players home.
