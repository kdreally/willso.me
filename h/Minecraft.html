        Minecraft is a þreesided sandbox game wiþ fower game settings þæt can be ruffly set into WSE: <a title="Survival">Oferlifing</a>, <a title="Hardcore">Arfeþþrow</a>, <a tite="Creative">Cræfthood</a>, and <a title="Adventure">Wayfare</a>. Oferlifing being þe raw setting, it is þe most wellknown wen it comes to Minecraft. Cræfthood is also ræþer <a title="popular">folkly</a>.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4><span id="Oferifing">Oferlifing</span></h4>
    <p>
        In Oferlifing, þe player must shelter <a title="Themselves, as singular. Dirct grammatical calque from MSE which is usually discouraged, but which is used well here.">hemself</a> before <a title="nightfall, dusk, sunset">nitefall</a> and <a title="fight">fite</a> hunger in a world of efil <a title="mobs">warries</a> and <a title="Fearing, easily frightened">friþful</a> <a title="Animals (as opposed to specifically deer)">deer</a>. Þis can be done by delfing undergrunde to get þings like coal, iron, redstone, and <a title="diamond(?)">hardstone</a>. Warries will <a title="spawn, as a verb">atew</a> in þe darknes, so its needful to make <a title="torches">þecens</a> to <a title="light up">aliten</a> þe players home. Þer is no goal in oferlifing besides to slay þe Ender <a title="dragon">Worm</a>, wice needeþ þe player to go to þe Neþer to get Blase Rods, wice hie can brook wiþ Endergroats to make an Eie of Ender. Wiþ þese eies, þe player can finde a stronghold and set hem in þe Ender Gateway to <a title="complete">fuldo</a> it. Þis <a title="giveth, gives">gifeþ</a> þe player an ingang to þe End, were hie can abide þe Ender Worm. Onse þe player cwelleþ þe worm, hie may leafe and see þe End Leeþ, oftentimes umbeþawt to mark þæt þe game is fuldone.

    <p>
        Þis setting is most like Oferlifing, but it is a dare unlike any oþer. Locked at þe hardest setting wiþ eferdeaþ, þe player must not starfe or else þe game is ofer. Þis makeþ it a harder kinde of Oferlifing. Some folks like to play þis setting sinse raw Oferlifing hæs become too eaþ ofer þe gears.
