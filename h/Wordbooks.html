<p>Wordbooks are a good source  of knowledge for learning a new language, and can help you familiarize yourself with its vocabulary and even its grammar. Such a wordbook doesn't exist for Willsome English yet, but the way WSE is written is using sources like the various Anglish wordbooks, the Middle English Dictionary, Etymonline, and so forth to arrive at a general idea of the willsome word (by applying spelling and sound changes). Some important wordbooks are given below.</p>

<h2><span id="Anglish">Anglish</span></h2>
<p>
  Anglish is the predecessor of Willsome English, and as such, their wordbooks are generally good for the purposes of finding native english equivalents to unwillsome MSE ones. The downside of using Anglish wordbooks is that they use MSE as a base and also include ON words that already exist in English. 
</p>
<br>
<h4><span id="ETA">The English Wordbook</span></h4>
<p>
    The English to Anglish wordbook of the Anglish Moot wiki is a resource wherin you can look up any words and find various Germanic equivalents under standard modern English orthography. It can be used as a reverse thesaurus of sorts, although a WSE writer should keep his guard up for Norse loanwords, creolized spellings, and so forth.
</p>
<p>
    Find it <a href="https://anglish.fandom.com/wiki/English_Wordbook">here.</a>
</p>
<p>
    This is the first recorded instance of any "wordbook" (dictionary) for Anglish. It was started in the middle of December 2005 by Oswax Scolere, better known as Hurlebatte.
</p>
<br>
<h4><span id="MootA">The (Anglish Moot) Anglish Wordbook</span></h4>
<p>Directly suceeding the former chronologically, the Anglish wordbook contains several anglish words and basic compounds as well as their meanings in MSE (called New English, like in linguistics)</p>
<p>
    Find it <a href="https://anglish.fandom.com/wiki/Anglish_Wordbook">here.</a>
</p>
<br>
<h4><span id="RootA">The (Roots English) Anglish Wordbook</span></h4>
<p>Roots English is a newer, more moderated and centralized kind of Anglish that has Hurlebatte as its most prominent member. Their wordbook contains "spellings with foreign influence reverted" which is a very odd way to spell "willsome". This wordbook is excellent for the Willsome writer for it cites most etymologies and sources.</p>

<h2><span id="Other">Other sources</span></h2>
<p><span id="MED">The Middle English Dictionary (<a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/med/">here.</a>) is a good resource for archaic spellings and words to revive</span></p>
<p><span id="EOL">Etymonline (<a href="https://Etymonline.con">here.</a>) is a very useful resource for seeing if a word you are on the fence about is willsome or not. Be warned, you will get lost in rabbit holes.</span></p>
<p><span id="OE"><a href-="https://Old-Engli.sh">Old-Engli.sh</a> is a website so free of bloat that visiting it is in itself a sort of detox to hyperbloated websites. It is by far my favourite resource to refer.</span></p>
<p>And finally, it goes without saying, real chads go further and directly refer the sources these very websites cite for further proof of validity.</p>
