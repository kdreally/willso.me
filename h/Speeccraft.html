    <p>This is intended to be as delightfully reactionary and backwards as I can make it, but under a phonology slightly
        closer to modern Indian English (although even the accent I use is hyperreactionary, because why not?) <br> For
        a more reasonable treatment of grammar, see <a href="Speececræft.html" title="Speececræft">Hunter's original
            version</a>.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>First, I will address the rules for inflection in Willsome English based on those in Old English, modernized
        lightly. There are 5 major cases: The Namenlic (Nominative), the Wragenlic (Accusative), the Forgifenlic
        (Dative), the Astreenenlic (Genitive), and the Toolfyllenlic (Instrumental). This is more conservative than even
        Icelandic, which fails to retain the Instrumental.</p>
    <p>There were three genders in old English, which are often called masculine, feminine, and neuter, but the way
        English handled these was rather complicated. It would naturally simplify a little into a more basic rule: The
        feminine is used for specifically feminine things, like women or a female animal (as well as concepts like
        learning, need, rest, and charity) whereas <a class="lingo"
            title="which was present in MSE up until the 21st century, albeit in a weaker form, called the Generic Masculine. You may know this from slightly archaic versions of sayings like 'He who does not learn from history is doomed to repeat it', which uses the masculine but doesn't exclude 'moids">everything
            animate that is not explicitly female is referred to in the masculine</a> &amp; everything inanimate (but
        for concepts, which are treated as feminine) is treated with a neuter gender.</p>
    <p>There were three numbers in Old English, but the dual form was only used in a set of first and second person
        pronouns. Otherwise, only singular and plural forms exist (dual pronouns are treated as plurals).</p>
    <p>There are three moods in Old, and by extension, Willsome English. The Sayenlic mete (Indicative mood) is used
        when the speaker is making a statement, the Wishenlic (Subjunctive) is used when the speaker is expressing a
        wish, reporting something, making a statement contrary to facts, or talking about something conditional on other
        variables. The Biddenlic (Imperative) is used only when the speaker is making a command.</p>
    <p>There are 3 major tenses (tides) in Willsome English: Forþawitten (Past), Anward (Present), & Toward (Future).
        Each of these has Strait (Simple), Ongoing (Continuous), and Wholemade (Perfect) shapes.</p>
    <p>First, let us look at a table of MSE pronouns, followed by a table of WSE bynames.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Now, several unwillsomehoods are present in this table.</p>
    <p>The Willsome English replacements of words like I by ic, and the entire They family wih the Hye family, spelling
        changes leading to, for instance, "my" being spelt "mye" for consistent application of the Magic E rule, and so
        forth are adressed in <a href="WillsomeEnglishEwbook.pdf">the Ewbook</a> and so we will focus on relative
        minutia in the following few paragraphs: The reflexive case, The entire second person, and (H)etafication.</p>
    <p>Starting with the most subjective: English, until relatively recently, was not a very centralized language.
        Different dialects found solutions to problems and titherto unforeseen improvements and widenings, narrowings,
        etc. on their own, and indeed, different writers used different modes of spelling, making it certain that no
        problem went unfaced. A major effect of this on Willsone English is that there is often more than one way to
        approach a problem.</p>
    <p>In the Ewbook, it is mentioned that in Old English, the third person masculine singular was He and the ` `
        feminine ` was Heo, both of which, over sound shifts, became converged to He. Most dialects understandably saw
        this as a problem, but adopted different solution. The very un-etymological She ended up being asserted on all
        of England for the 3pfs, because of the Chancery Standard . Other dialects had a more etymological solution,
        which was to change the 3pfs to Hoo. This caught on, until the aforementioned disastrous standard. It would also
        have raised problems when it could be confused with "who". However, it is possible to imagine a dialect that
        refuses to change the pronoun. Such a hypothetical dialect, if the thinker in whose mind it found an abode had
        any sense of humour at all, might also be one of the many historical dialects to ditch the neuter pronouns
        entirely, using the masculine equivalents in their stead.</p>
    <p>That is merely a though experiment and you can chose to adopt any amount of it, including none.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The Second Person in MSE is an inglorious trainwreck to so great a degree that every linguist has proposed some
        solution to it. I, being distinct in my lack of linguistics education, is to blame the French and start over.
    </p>
    <p>Coming directly (with updated phonology) from Old English, one would use the Þue family for the Second person
        singular, and Git and Gew for dual and plural. Note that the usage of ye for the accusative/dative is attested
        to this day in dialects of MSE. Note also that there is no "respectful" istinction made here. That entered
        middle english under the influence of the French tu-vous distinction, and the plural aspect of you was lost.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The reflexive case is unecessary for the first and second person singular, but would likely exist by mere analogy
        with the rest.</p>
    <p>Below is a table of common WSE forms of the pronouns (called bynames in WSE, reflecting their grammatical purpose
        as sidesteps of using nouns, called <a class="lingo"
            title="the word name in turn reflects the noun's purpose in WSE unlike MSE 'noun' which is senselessly borrowed from French">names</a>

    <p>That's what I call pronouns!</p>
    <p>Note that everywhere that something isn't prescribed in the table, namely everywhere, you can make etymologically
        and historically reasonable changes. I would personally not mind blatant absurdities like calquing a T-V
        distinction as long as you know what you're actually doing.</p>
    <p>So far, we've talked about pronouns, or bynames as they're called in WSE. But what about nouns? Nouns are called
        names in WSE, and there is a history to English noun declension that becomes a lot more clear when you study Old
        English. To make it a bit more fun, I've reproduced full Old English noun grammar. You can keep all of this,
        none of it, or whatever suits your fancy. If you cant comprehend anything beyond strong/weak a-stems, leave it
        at that. Hell, even MSE is too complex for many people, which is also fine. WSE is flexible and can be more
        arcane than Old English or hypercreolized depending on your fancy, though I and Hunter certainly encourage
        trying to go a bit hard on yourself with the level of reaction in your grammar. WSE works best when you accept
        the Middle English Creole hypothesis.</p>
    <p>It's worth noting at this point that this framework is meant to lay out everything and I myself can't admit to
        actually knowing jack about how to put much of it into use, but goddamnit its fun when you can churn out
        sentences in complete internal agreement.</p>
    <br>
    <h3><span id="names">Names</span></h3>
    <br>
    <p>Old English had big boy noun declension. First, every noun had a gender. Animate things were male, unless you
        knew or wanted to emphasize that they were female or feminine, in which case they were feminine. Concepts (like
        help, rest, sleep, or thrill) are also feminine. Everything else, from rocks to twigs to the Sun, is neuter.
        Second, every noun had a final sound. Like horn, which ended with a consonant, or oxa (ox) which ended with a
        vowel. There were words that ended with -u in Orþeec (the earliest Germanic language) which had their own
        declension. Others that ended in -u or -o fell into a different class. These types were called strong, weak, u,
        and ƿ "a-stems", respectively. There also exist so called I-mutants and indeclinables (like lengu, which does
        not refer to the South Indian attire, but instead to the word for length, which, being a concept, was
        feminine.). What an a-stem is, nobody knows (and everybody who tells you otherwise is lying to you). </p>

        two-syllabled (like "sunu"), or long-stemmed one-syllabled (like "hand").</p>
    <p>They had the same endings for both genders, but slightly different endings depending on which of the two types

    <p>To conclude, I will give you a much smaller table, for nouns ending in -o/-u, which have become rarer over time,
        presumably because writers stopped wanting to artificially add words to this category after declension
        simplified bigtime under Norman influence. After that, I'll leave this topic for now with a table on
        I-mutations, and we'll move on to articles</p>

    <p>There is more to Old English grammatical infixes, which are derived from a pan-Germanic trend called umlaut (WSE
        umblude, umb meaning around and lude meaning sound, akin to Anglish "loud"). The <a
            href="https://rootsenglish.miraheze.org">Anglish Wiki</a> has a page on Umlauts and there are plans to
        create a more in depth part two of the Ewbook which will explain concepts like this. The Old English Nomitative
        Singular (Namenlic Onelic) is considered the default word, and all additions and changes to it across the rest
        of the tables are considered grammatical affixes. A page on sound changes from Old English is being worked on
        which you can refer to modernize the tables to Willsome English yourself, or if you have a more conservative or
        more liberal view of phonological evolution and such, you can apply that. That's why Old English tables are
        being reproduced.</p>
    <p>Enough about names, let's talk interrogatives. Here, I will briefly abandon using Old English as my example and
        just give you a pretty boring, pre-accented WSE declension, that preserves 99% of the complexity of OE. This,
        you can use as a base to slightly modify as you see fit,</p>

    <p>The Old English ancestor of Whether (Hwæðer) originally was akin to a dual form of which, i.e. which of two. It's
        modern use emerged in the 1650's which makes me want to say French influence was involved, but I actually see no
        reason why whether couldn't take on it's MSE meaning, at least dialectally. Experiment with sentence structures
        and see for yourself. The expected WSE form of the word is Weþer, and like in Old English, it would follow
        strong-adjectival declension. See below, or click <a href="#adj">here</a>.</p>
    <p>The word which, descended from Old English Hwilc (as in the runeleeþ, first stanza, feoh byþ frofur, firm
        ge<b>hwilc</b>), also follows that declension pattern. The word in WSE would be somehing like wilc. Other word
        derived from Old English include: Swilc (such), awilc (each, everyone), notwilc/newilc (Somebody I don't know),
        somewilc (some), notweþer/neweþer (none), sweþer (whichever).</p>

    <h3>Adjectives</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Adjectives are word that add information, hence they are called ekers (adders) in Willsome English. The adjective
        is declined to agree with the noun in case, gender, and number. Strong adjectives are inflected for all three
        separately. Since I cannot make 3D tables, I will use a single table for all cases, all three genders, and both
        numbers. Any adjective can be used weakly or strongly. Weakly when it was used as part of a nickname, or when it
        followed a demonstrative, an article, or a posessive pronoun of the first or second person. Strongly in all
        other cases. Note that some adjectives in OE were universally weak, like most ordinal numbers, and others, like
        oðer (second) were universally strong. Note also that all comparatives (better, worse, longer, etc.) have weak
        declension. Weak adjectival declension was the same as weak nounal declension, for which see above or click <a
            href="weak">here</a>.</p>

    <p>Adjectives ending in o or u, much like with nouns, have that turn into a w when the grammatical suffixes they are
        inflected with start with a vowel. Monosyllabic adjectives ending with æ followed by a consonant (glad, sad,
        bad, etc.) had it turn into an "a" when grammatical suffixes start with a vowel, back in Old English. There's no
        reason that couldn't disappear as time went on, but there's no reason it should, either.</p>
<p>Further, I would like to talk about something that's a lot simpler in MSE than in WSE. That is article inflection. The article (in WSE, warfer, meaning joint) is inflected for gender and case + a generic plural form.</p>

    <p>Further, this is only the definite article ("the" in MSE), but in MSE we also have indefinite articles.</p>
    <p>The indefinite article does not exist per se in WSE, but a similar function is served by number inflection. Inflecting the number one (1) for case and gender (one was always singular by definition, everything else was always plural) would have the effect of pointing to "a specific" thing. ones spideres web -> a particular spider's web.</p>
<p>Likewise, however, other numbers (tales) may be inflected. One, two, and three have an especially conservative declension but all numbers may be declined.</p>
<p>Here is the expected modernization of the Old English declension of "one"</p>

<p>Before introducing you to the generic number inflection used for all other numbers when they are not directly preceding the subject, I will first name them all. The cardinal numbers are:</p>
<ol>
    <li>*</li>
    <li>*</li>
    <li>*</li>
    <li><a class="lingo" title="Dialectally, fower">Feewer</a></li>
    <li>Fyfe</li>
    <li><a class="lingo" title="Also possible: Syx, sgix">Syex</a></li>
    <li>Seafen</li>
    <li><a class="lingo" title="Afte">Ate</a></li>
    <li><a class="lingo" title="Hard g, but may be dialectally softened. There is nothing unwillsome abourt nine, but it is a liberal and unlikely modernaizatiom">Nygon</a></li>
    <li><a class="lingo" title="Ten is not unwillsome, but it is a bad modernization">Tean</a></li>
    <li><a class="lingo" title="Or 1leafen, with Twelve becoming 2leafen. Or Elve">Enleafen</a></li>
    <li>Twelfe</li>
    <li>3&tean</li>
    <li>4&tean</li>
    <li>5&tean</li>
    <li>6&tean</li>
    <li>7&tean</li>
    <li>8&tean</li>
    <li>9&tean</li>
    <li><a class="lingo" title="Twegen + ty. Ty can be restored to tig but that's a bit excessive. Twegen was reduced to twe- in the oldest recorded instances of this word, so reverting that would be a purely aesthetic choice, albeit one I might end up liking,">twenty</a></li>
</ol>
<p>And it goes on. The general pattern is [units place] and [tens place] i.e. 5&10 or "fife and tean" or "fifeandtean" as well as something like 5&20 or "fife and twenty" for fifteen and twenty-five respectively. For multiples of ten, it's generally a phonotactically truncated standard for of the number with the tens suffix "tig". After and including seventy, tens are prefixed with "hund". They are treated as pure multiples of ten until 120. (so like, you'd have nigon&hundtwelfty, and then you'd have 1hundred&þryety. Also note, one hundre, as in German einhundret</p>
<p>The numbers after and including 4 are as easy to decline as their predecessors are hard. In the namenlic or wragenlic abying, they end with an "e". In forgifenlic or toolfyllenlic, with "um". In astreenenlic, with an "a". When directly prefixing what they describe, they are not inflected and are used in standard form.</p>
<p>Exactly one order of mangnitude above a hundred (hund or hundred or hundteanty. Hund and hundred are interchangably used for the cuantity wheras hundteanty is used for specifically numerical purposes, like a slightly more pronounced version of the "a" vs "one" hundred distinction in MSE) is a thousand, or in WSE, one þusend.</p>
<p>After a hundred thousand comes a million, or as we say in Willsome English, . . .</p>
<br>
<p>Oh.</p>
<br>
<p>You see, the englesexes never needed to count past 999,999 for the very good reason that there probably weren't even more than a few dozen million people on the planet at that time. Only after 1066 did numbers like that tart becoming relevant enough to warrent names.</p>
<p>So, that means that we don't know that the willsome version would look like. Feel free to use million, since it's perfectly possible that it could be adopted voluntarily. Or use an Anglish archaism "ÞusendÞusend", or perhaps calque something from a mathematical text in Sanskrit or Greek or somesuch, since scholaftical languages were a big thing until the unwillsome central banks' decivilizing effect lowered time preference so much that no normal functioning people wanted to become scholars, and then they bribed the remaining sociopaths away with distinctly-not-empty promises of power and prestige, thus making their (scholastical languages') use completely irrelevant.</p>
<p>But that's just one kind of number. There's a wide variety of number forms we use on a day to day basis. Let us talk about Ordinals, shall we?</p>
<p>ETA: Next sunday?</p>
    <!--negative article: none (ne one) nany (ne any)
indefinite article: number declension
also: decline all numbers ever?
Also do verbs, verbs are mega bases
Conjunctions? Maybe oþ for or? Or oþe? Also bring back optinal form oþ(e)....oþ(e).... for either or? And ne.....ne.... for neither nor? Why did gif become if? Why did þonne become then? 
Prepositions? Why did mid become with? What happened to the instrumental meaning of mid, as in feohtan mid hornum from stanza ᚠ of the runeleeþ? Why did Þurh become Through (WSE Þrew)? Bring back archaic andlong for along? Andlongside for alongside? What became of so many of these little oddities of OE? I hate france so much dude its not evn funny.
What happened to saying Alfreðes Cyniges instead of King Alfried's?
Donaldes Mces?
Orthography & pronounciation. What happened to geminated consonants like in -nesse /ᚾᛖᛋᛋᚪ/ -> MSE ness /ᚾᛖᛋ/? Is magic e french influence or consequence of schwa deletion? Is schwa deletion statist influence? How is the contraction marker ' even legal? Shouldn't the your-you're merger reflect by merging the spellings of those two words? Why doesn't The President's House become the Presidents House? Why doesn't doesn't beome doesnt? Are twitter bots and AI and teachers responsible for linguistic stagnation?
Maths and science. Why memorize greek letters when using ᚠᚢᚦᚩᚱᚳ is much easier? Why use ash, birch, gift, and so on for alpha, beta, gamma, and so on, when using fee, ure, þorn, is more sensible? Unless you're using, for instance, lambada for wave<b>l</b>ength in which case using lay is unerstandable, but still.
Esoteric languages are nice and all but why does scientific nomclature need so much latin and greek? Spice it up by
having available the entire lexicons of every old language: OE, Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, Archaic Finnish, Old Bulgarian,
Primitive Irish, etc. Would be omega bases.-->
