	<!--Instead of having to type class="impress" on both my h1 and h4 tags, I can save precious bits by wrapping them in a div tag with that class.
	Since that's the class that denotes that these headings are centered, I can center both of them his way.
	This becomes very important when you have classes with long names and many adjacent elements use that class, or several classes. 
	It's not a huge deal, but it does matter a bit.-->
