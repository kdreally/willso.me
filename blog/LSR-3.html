    <p>Spelling in WSE does not always completely convey the pronounciation, and while it's way clearer than MSE, there's always exceptions to every rule. Like how the e is not magic in edge, and in Hunter's mode of spelling, in singe (which I would spell sindg), rice (I use ric), etc. Or how the g at the beginning of a word is generally soft, except when it isn't, like in great, god, and so forth.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I care about accurate representation of the sounds because most beginners will not have Hunter as a teacher to guide them through the pronounciation of words, or will lack a formula for generating their own phonology. (I simply apply the phonology of Vedic Sanskrit to create an incredibly thick Tamil-esque accent) Furthermore, some might revert parts of the Great Vowel Shift, and on a lower level, people might simply merge or distinguish sounds other's don't. For this reason, using a phonological alphabet for the language is counterproductive at best and impossible at worst.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My solution is an alphabet that represents every sound that you might wish to differentiate in your bytung, alongside reversions you might want to make.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Words will have 2 renditions for the complete "phonetic" rendition. The word itself, followed by its Old English form in brackets, followed by its LSR rendition.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The ludestafes are: a, æ, b, c, d, ð, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, þ, r, s, t, u, (ú), v, w, ƿ, y, z. There are also runes used: ᚠ, ᚩ, ᚱ, ᚷ, ᛇ, ᛚ, ᛝ, ᛟ, ᛠ</p>
    <br>
    <p>Vowels are used for the vowels, and a macron is placed above them to indicate whether they are long or short. Phonemic length is indicated much like IPA by putting two dots after the given vowel. Stress can be indicated by surrounding middots around the streassed syllables.</p>
    <p>Notably, c is only used for its soft value. It's hard value is represented by k. Likewise, f is used for soft f like in fee, but a hard f like in enuff is represented by the rune derived from Fuþorc feoh. likewise with g/ᚷ. j does not have its IPA value, but makes the dg sounde in judge. L and ᛚ are functionally equivalent in all extant dialects of WSE, but ᛚ should be used when dealing with historic "hl". So Ewleap would be Ewleap[ǣhlyp][᛫ēu᛫ᛚᛠp]. Likewise, use ᚱ for historic "hr". ᛝ should be used wherever it'd be used in runic writ. ᛟ is used for schwa and u is used for "oo" while ū is used for the long value of u, meaning there is no room for short u. To remedy this, ú may be used instead. v should be used where f makes a f sound like efen -> [᛫ē᛫vᛟn]. ƿ should be used for "hard w" which is merged with the regular value in some dialects. Y is used based on etymology and generally makes the same sound as i of the same phonetic value followed by a soft g.</p>
    <p>Some runes have not been mentioned. ᚩ refers to phonemes that have historically been "oa", which had a sound distinct from [ō᛬] prior to the (generally accepted to be) willsome dialectal drift that occured around the end of the 16th century and marked the beginning of the Eary New English period. Likewise, ᛠ represents historic "ea". Finally, ᛇ is used to mark those /x/ sounds that disappeared without a trace. (NOT ones that became a hardened f)</p>
