    The primary meeting place of the Volchads until late July of 2020 was the discord server for the r/voluntaryistmemes
    subreddit, which at its peak had about 600 members, at least 500 of which were outspoken libertarians (and not F&G
    liberalalas). A major threat to the health of the room was wrought by the actions of Team Discord (not that) shortly
    after the death of George Floyd, a drug criminal who had at the time had lethal dosages of more than two
    recreational drugs in his body and who had previously been convicted of violent crimes. Discord said at first that
    they "weren't banning words" and were only going to ban racism and not just any old gamer words, but this promise
    was shortly thereafter broken and there was a literal digital Kristallnacht of our servers, the persecution so great
    it has left emotional scars that echo throughout the universe (it's even spelled out in the Cosmic Microwave
    Background). On 22nd of July, year of our lord 2020, Glue created a room on the Matrix protocol where we could
    congregate but it was largely ignored. Only Varad, Glue, and Hunter really made a proper switch, while the main
    Janny of the server - Skunks - stupidly made the "official" backup room on not-yet-revealed-to-be(-but-someday-will)
    spyware service Telegram. Skunks has since made a moderately intelligent return to the volchad realm. We have a
    deeply rooted cultural memory of the digital persuction we have undergone, hence why we have created small
    settlements throughout the cyberspace. We promise not to expand via imperialism ;)
