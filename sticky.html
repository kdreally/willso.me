The man is based, read his books, watch his PFS/MisesU speeches. https://contrakrugman.com/ - The Contra Krugman podcast. Ended in mid 2020 with 225 episodes, each packed with both banter and education. Listening to multiple episodes a day for many days straight might cause severe issues such as involuntary Tom Woods impressions and accute split personality disorder. Willsome English Waterway Ideology is great and everything but there's other common topics of discussion this room as well, such as furry stalin porn, and the use of native Anglo-Saxon words over involuntary words forced into English, as part of a project called Willsome English which stemmed out of Anglish. You can find the wiki at https://willsomeenglish.miraheze.org or ask somebody with a copy to print it out and mail it to you, at which point they will wiegh the pros and cons of such and will get back to you in time with a response. Varad is working on a translation of his novel in the dialect, and most active posters in the room use it formally and informally in varying amounts, so practicing will be no issue. Just remember not to forget mainstream English ;). afterwrit: if þue wishest to help wiþ þis upnimming, merely go ahead and help. þye name may or may not go on any kind of acknowledging roster but at least þue willest hafe þe knowledge þat þue helped unk when wit needed it most. Lore Library: The primary meeting place of the Volchads until late July of 2020 was the discord server for the r/voluntaryistmemes subreddit, which at its peak had about 600 members, at least 500 of which were outspoken libertarians (and not F&G liberalalas). A major threat to the health of the room was wrought by the actions of Team Discord (not that) shortly after the death of George Floyd, a drug criminal who had at the time had lethal dosages of more than two recreational drugs in his body and who had previously been convicted of violent crimes. Discord said at first that they "weren't banning words" and were only going to ban racism and not just any old gamer words, but this promise was shortly thereafter broken and there was a literal digital Kristallnacht of our servers, the persecution so great it has left emotional scars that echo throughout the universe (it's even spelled out in the Cosmic Microwave Background). On 22nd of July, year of our lord 2020, Glue created a room on the Matrix protocol where we could congregate but it was largely ignored. Only Varad, Glue, and Hunter really made a proper switch, while the main Janny of the server - Skunks - stupidly made the "official" backup room on not-yet-revealed-to-be(-but-someday-will) spyware service Telegram. Skunks has since made a moderately intelligent return to the volchad realm. We have a deeply rooted cultural memory of the digital persuction we have undergone, hence why we have created small settlements throughout the cyberspace. We promise not to expand via imperialism ;) --> </p>
