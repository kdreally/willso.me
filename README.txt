Hello! This repository is intended for others to contribute to the development of not only Willso.me itself, but to Willsome English also, by being able to make inputs into the /h/ portion of the website containing the Ewbook, Wordbook, fonts, and to the Wiki articles.
Any and all contributions are welcome and will be considered.
If you request your work be published under any kind of license, I will simply not publish it, as I do not believe licenses are legitimate. I will not publicize your work because I refuse to do so under a license, and doing so without may be against your wishes, which I do not want. 
If you are okay with your work being published with no restriction on its usage by readers (beyond requests, like are made in the "Ã°is work . . ." page of the WSE Ewbook), then your work will be reviewed and hopefully published.

Your help may earn you renumeration in Monero (XMR), but no promises are made and my Monero balance itself is rather limited. 

HELP WANTED:-
+More articles in WSE
+Example sentences on /h/Norse in WSE.


HELP  NEEDED:-
